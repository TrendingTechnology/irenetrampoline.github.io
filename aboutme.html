  <h1>About me</h1>
  <p>I love bringing data to life through product insights and machine learning.</p>

    <p>As the only Data Scientist at Dropbox, I have worked on the whole data spectrum
including robust infrastructure, predictive analytics, and engaging visualizations.
Before Dropbox, I interned at Knewton and researched at the Harvard Business
School with Professors Ben Edelman and Michael Luca.</p>

<p>I am committed to empowering women in technology and recently spoke at Grace
Hopper 2015.</p>

<p>I graduated from Harvard University in 2014 where I earned a joint AB/SM. My
Bachelors was in Applied Math in Economics and Computer Science, and my Masters
was in Computational Engineering.</p>
