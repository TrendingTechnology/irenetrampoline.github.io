      <description>Machine Learning (6.867) [Course website]
Principles, techniques, and algorithms in machine learning from the point of view of statistical inference; representation, generalization, and model selection; and methods such as linear/additive models, active learning, boosting, support vector machines, non-parametric Bayesian methods, hidden Markov models, and Bayesian networks. The course will give the student the basic ideas and intuition behind modern machine learning methods as well as a bit more formal understanding of how, why, and when they work.</description>

FAQs How can I join the group as a PhD student? Graduate admissions are handled at the department level at MIT, so please first apply to the MIT EECS or MIT MEMP departments.
For advice on CS PhD admissions, Jean Yang and Philip Guo have written useful guides.
How can I join the group as a UROP/SuperUROP or MEng student?</description>

      <description>Machine Learning Perspective Making ML work in high-stakes settings
Recently developed techniques in machine learning have proven adept at solving problems in computer vision, natural language processing, board games, video games, and other domains where computers had previously struggled to outperform humans.
However, deployment in high-stakes settings is still limited, for good reasons:
 Predictive models alone may be insufficient - we may care about causal questions (as in personalized medicine), not just predictive ones.</description>
