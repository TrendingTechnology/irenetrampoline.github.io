# Why healthcare?

 - big amounts of data [cite Halamka petabytes]
 - AWS helps improve ease, still secure for HIPAA compliance [Halamka]
 - unifying (??) 
 - FDA approval is hard but important. Minor updates only need notification but new models need reapproval [Arterys]
 - new field: huge question of validity of field 


# Interpretability

# Reinforcement learning making a move 

- susan murphy
- colin stultz

# Creative approaches

 - Social media embeddings can predict mental health inference 
 - Modeling outcomes of interventions using CNN/LSTM (physilogical words to indicate missingness), using vasopressor/ventilation (maximally activate output node) [Harini]
 - 

# Successes in computer vision spilling over

# General ML methods

 - Only backpropgate info from existing data to handle missing components [arterys]
 - Mturk for pose estimation
 - [<a href="http://mucmd.org">test <i class="fa fa-user"></i></a>]

# Odds and ends
