			<h1>About</h1>
			<p>I work at <a href="http://www.dropbox.com">Dropbox</a>, where I am a data scientist, which covers the range from 
			product insights and analytics to machine learning engineering. Currently
			I am focusing on document organization. Prior work includes abuse 
			detection, user retention prediction, and company metric definition.
			</p>

			<p>
			Prior to Dropbox, I studied Applied Math, Computer Science, and Economics 
			at Harvard University where I received a joint AB/SM from the <a href="http://iacs.seas.harvard.edu/">Institute
			of Computational Science</a>. 
			</p>

			<p>
			In my free time, I enjoy watercolor painting, half-marathon training, and chocolate.
