h1. This is my (burgeoning) blog

It is run using "Jekyll":http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll to turn Markdown files
into a static site whenever I push this repository to GitHub.

It is heavily based on "this template":https://github.com/mojombo/mojombo.github.io
thanks to "Tom Preston-Werner":http://tom.preston-werner.com/.
