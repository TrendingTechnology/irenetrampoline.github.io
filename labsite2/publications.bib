  abstract = {To understand the empirical success of approximate MAP inference, recent work (Lang et al., 2018) has shown that some popular approximation algorithms perform very well when the input instance is stable. The simplest stability condition assumes that the MAP solution does not change at all when some of the pairwise potentials are (adversarially) perturbed. Unfortunately, this strong condition does not seem to be satisfied in practice. In this paper, we introduce a significantly more relaxed condition that only requires blocks (portions) of an input instance to be stable. Under this block stability condition, we prove that the pairwise LP relaxation is persistent on the stable blocks. We complement our theoretical results with an empirical evaluation of real-world MAP inference instances from computer vision. We design an algorithm to find stable blocks, and find that these real instances have large stable regions. Our work gives a theoretical explanation for the widespread empirical phenomenon of persistency for this LP relaxation.}

  abstract = {Much attention has been devoted recently to the development of machine learning algorithms with the goal of improving treatment policies in healthcare. Reinforcement learning (RL) is a sub-field within machine learning that is concerned with learning how to make sequences of decisions so as to optimize long-term effects. Already, RL algorithms have been proposed to identify decision-making strategies for mechanical ventilation, sepsis management and treatment of schizophrenia. However, before implementing treatment policies learned by black-box algorithms in high-stakes clinical decision problems, special care must be taken in the evaluation of these policies. In this document, our goal is to expose some of the subtleties associated with evaluating RL algorithms in healthcare. We aim to provide a conceptual starting point for clinical and computational researchers to ask the right questions when designing and evaluating algorithms for new ways of treating patients. In the following, we describe how choices about how to summarize a history, variance of statistical estimators, and confounders in more ad-hoc measures can result in unreliable, even misleading estimates of the quality of a treatment policy. We also provide suggestions for mitigating these effects---for while there is much promise for mining observational health data to uncover better treatment policies, evaluation must be performed thoughtfully.}

In sensitive applications such as healthcare or criminal justice, this trade-off is often undesirable as any increase in prediction error could have devastating consequences. In this work, we argue that the fairness of predictions should be evaluated in context of the data, and that unfairness induced by inadequate samples sizes or unmeasured predictive variables should be addressed through data collection, rather than by constraining the model. We decompose cost-based metrics of discrimination into bias, variance, and noise, and propose actions aimed at estimating and reducing each term. Finally, we perform case-studies on prediction of income, mortality, and review ratings, confirming the value of this analysis. We find that data collection is often a means to reduce discrimination without sacrificing accuracy.}

Under this model, we derive an intuitive estimator for the Bayes Factor that represents similarity as the amount of overlap in representation space shared by different points. The estimator we derive relies on a query-conditional latent reasoning network, that parameterizes a distribution over the latent space of the deep generative model. The latent reasoning network is trained to amortize the posterior-predictive distribution under a hierarchical model using supervised data and a max-margin learning algorithm. We explore how the model may be used to focus the data variations captured in the latent space of the deep generative model and how this may be used to build new algorithms for few-shot learning.},

While AVI has enabled efficient training of deep generative models such as variational autoencoders (VAE), recent empirical work suggests that inference networks can produce suboptimal variational parameters. We propose a hybrid approach, to use AVI to initialize the variational parameters and run stochastic variational inference (SVI) to refine them. Crucially, the local SVI procedure is itself differentiable, so the inference network and generative model can be trained end-to-end with gradient-based optimization. This semi-amortized approach enables the use of rich generative models without experiencing the posterior-collapse phenomenon common in training VAEs for problems like text generation. Experiments show this approach outperforms strong autoregressive and variational baselines on standard text and image datasets.}

The goal of this paper is to partially explain the performance of alpha-expansion and an LP relaxation algorithm on MAP inference in Ferromagnetic Potts models (FPMs). Our main results give stability conditions under which these two algorithms provably recover the optimal MAP solution. These theoretical results complement numerous empirical observations of good performance.}

We focus on distributional shift that arises in causal inference from observational data and in unsupervised domain adaptation. We pose both of these problems as prediction under a shift in design. Popular methods for overcoming distributional shift make unrealistic assumptions such as having a well-specified model or knowing the policy that gave rise to the observed data. Other methods are hindered by their need for a pre-specified metric for comparing observations, or by poor asymptotic properties. We devise a bound on the generalization error under design shift, incorporating both representation learning and sample re-weighting. Based on the bound, we propose an algorithmic framework that does not require any of the above assumptions and which is asymptotically consistent. We empirically study the new framework using two synthetic datasets, and demonstrate its effectiveness compared to previous methods.}

In time series prediction and other related tasks, it has been noted that missing values and their missing patterns are often correlated with the target labels, a.k.a., informative missingness. There is very limited work on exploiting the missing patterns for effective imputation and improving prediction performance. In this paper, we develop novel deep learning models, namely GRU-D, as one of the early attempts. GRU-D is based on Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), a state-of-the-art recurrent neural network. It takes two representations of missing patterns, i.e., masking and time interval, and effectively incorporates them into a deep model architecture so that it not only captures the long-term temporal dependencies in time series, but also utilizes the missing patterns to achieve better prediction results. Experiments of time series classification tasks on real-world clinical datasets (MIMIC-III, PhysioNet) and synthetic datasets demonstrate that our models achieve state-of-the-art performance and provide useful insights for better understanding and utilization of missing values in time series analysis.},

However, limited data availability across cell types has hindered our capacity to leverage or explore the cell specificity of these perturbations. While recent efforts have generated a large number of drug perturbation profiles across a variety of human cell types, many gaps remain in this combinatorial drug-cell space. Hence, we asked whether it is possible to fill these gaps by predicting cell-specific drug perturbation profiles using available expression data from related conditions -- i.e. from other drugs and cell types. We developed a computational framework that first arranges existing profiles into a three-dimensional array (or tensor) indexed by drugs, genes, and cell types, and then uses either local (nearest-neighbors) or global (tensor completion) information to predict unmeasured profiles. We evaluate prediction accuracy using a variety of metrics, and find that the two methods have complementary performance, each superior in different regions in the drug-cell space. Predictions achieve correlations of 0.68 with true values, and maintain accurate differentially expressed genes (AUC 0.81). Finally, we demonstrate that the predicted profiles add value for making downstream associations with drug targets and therapeutic classes.}

The most important aspect of inferring causal effects from observational data is the handling of confounders, factors that affect both an intervention and its outcome. A carefully designed observational study attempts to measure all important confounders. However, even if one does not have direct access to all confounders, there may exist noisy and uncertain measurement of proxies for confounders. We build on recent advances in latent variable modelling to simultaneously estimate the unknown latent space summarizing the confounders and the causal effect. Our method is based on Variational Autoencoders (VAE) which follow the causal structure of inference with proxies. We show our method is significantly more robust than existing methods, and matches the state-of-the-art on previous benchmarks focused on individual treatment effects.}

Existing platforms rely on knowledge bases manually compiled through a labor-intensive process or automatically derived using simple pairwise statistics. This study explored an automated process to learn high quality knowledge bases linking diseases and symptoms directly from electronic medical records. Medical concepts were extracted from 273,174 deidentified patient records and maximum likelihood estimation of three probabilistic models was used to automatically construct knowledge graphs: logistic regression, naive Bayes classifier and a Bayesian network using noisy OR gates. A graph of disease-symptom relationships was elicited from the learned parameters and the constructed knowledge graphs were evaluated and validated, with permission, against Google's manually-constructed knowledge graph and against expert physician opinions. Our study shows that direct and automated construction of high quality health knowledge graphs from medical records using rudimentary concept extraction is feasible. The noisy OR model produces a high quality knowledge graph reaching precision of 0.85 for a recall of 0.6 in the clinical evaluation. Noisy OR significantly outperforms all tested models across evaluation frameworks (p&lt;0.01).}

We give a new theoretical analysis and family of algorithms for predicting individual treatment effect (ITE) from observational data, under the assumption known as strong ignorability. The algorithms learn a "balanced" representation such that the induced treated and control distributions look similar. We give a novel, simple and intuitive generalization-error bound showing that the expected ITE estimation error of a representation is bounded by a sum of the standard generalization-error of that representation and the distance between the treated and control distributions induced by the representation. We use Integral Probability Metrics to measure distances between distributions, deriving explicit bounds for the Wasserstein and Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) distances. Experiments on real and simulated data show the new algorithms match or outperform the state-of-the-art.}

We provide a novel algorithm to simultaneously perform representation learning for the input data and learning of the hierarchical predictor. Our approach optimizes an objective function which favors balanced and easily-separable multi-way node partitions. We theoretically analyze this objective, showing that it gives rise to a boosting style property and a bound on classification error. We next show how to extend the algorithm to conditional density estimation. We empirically validate both variants of the algorithm on text classification and language modeling, respectively, and show that they compare favorably to common baselines in terms of accuracy and running time.}

methods still rely mainly on assessing self-reported depressive symptoms, methods that originated more than fifty years ago. These methods, which usually involve filling out surveys or engaging in face-to-face interviews, provide limited accuracy and reliability and are costly to track and scale. In this paper, we develop and test the efficacy of machine learning techniques applied to objective data captured passively and continuously from E4 wearable wristbands and from sensors in an Android phone for predicting the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS). Input data include electrodermal activity (EDA), sleep behavior, motion, phone-based communication, location changes, and phone usage patterns. We introduce our feature generation and transformation process, imputing missing clinical scores from self-reported measures, and predicting depression severity from continuous sensor measurements. While HDRS ranges between 0 and 52, we were able to impute it with 2.8 RMSE and predict it with 4.5 RMSE which are low relative errors. Analyzing the features and their relation to depressive symptoms, we found that poor mental health was accompanied by more irregular sleep, less motion, fewer incoming messages, less variability in location patterns, and higher asymmetry of EDA between the right and the left wrists.}

In data validation, Algorithm 1 had a sensitivity of 0.98 and positive predictive value (PPV) of 0.14 for ADHF.

Based on a brief survey of three providers who perform chart review for ADHF, we estimated providers spent 8.6 minutes per chart review; using this this parameter, we estimated providers would spend 61.4, 57.3, 28.7, and 25.3 minutes on secondary chart review for each case of ADHF if initial screening was done with algorithms 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively. In conclusion, machine learning algorithms with unstructured notes had best performance for identification of ADHF and can improve provider efficiency for delivery of quality improvement interventions.}

Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSK) conducts over 500 therapeutic trials at one time; most are focused on a single type of cancer (e.g. breast, lung) reflecting subspecialized nature of care. However, clinical trial accrual is a challenge as patient-trial matching is a slow and manual process. We address this challenge via a machine learning-powered clinical trial recommendation engine designed to be deployed at the point of care.}

We used contextual autocomplete, a user interface that ranks concepts by their predicted probability, to help nurses enter data about a patientâs reason for visiting the ED. Predicted probabilities were calculated using a previously derived model based on triage vital signs and a brief free text note. We evaluated the percentage and quality of structured data captured using a prospective before-and-after study design. A total of 279,231 patient encounters were analyzed. Structured data capture improved from 26.2\% to 97.2\% (p&lt;0.0001). During the post-implementation period, presenting problems
were more complete (3.35 vs 3.66; p=0.0004), as precise (3.59 vs. 3.74; p=0.1), and higher in overall quality (3.38 vs. 3.72; p=0.0002). Our system reduced the mean number of keystrokes required to document a presenting problem from 11.6 to 0.6 (p&lt;0.0001), a 95\% improvement. We have thus demonstrated a technique that captures structured data on nearly all patients. We estimate that our system reduces the number of man-hours required annually to type presenting problems at our institution from 92.5 hours to 4.8 hours. In conclusion, implementation of a contextual autocomplete system resulted in improved structured data capture, ontology usage compliance, and data quality.}

We evaluate this approach in healthcare by using longitudinal measurements of lab tests, one of the more raw signals of a patient's health state widely available in clinical data, to predict disease onsets. In particular, we train a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network and two novel convolutional neural networks for multi-task prediction of disease onset for 133 conditions based on 18 common lab tests measured over time in a cohort of 298K patients derived from 8 years of administrative claims data. We compare the neural networks to a logistic regression with several hand-engineered, clinically relevant features. We find that the representation-based learning approaches significantly outperform this baseline. We believe that our work suggests a new avenue for patient risk stratification based solely on lab results.}

Problem lists may be useful for case identification but are often inaccurate or incomplete. Machine-learning approaches may improve accuracy of identification but can be limited by complexity of implementation. Our objective was to develop algorithms that use readily available clinical data to identify patients with heart failure while in the hospital. In this study of 47,119 hospitalizations, inclusion of heart failure on the problem list had a sensitivity of 0.40 and a positive predictive value (PPV) of 0.96. A logistic regression model with clinical data was associated with a sensitivity of 0.68 and PPV of 0.90, whereas a machine-learning algorithm that used free text had a sensitivity of 0.83 and a PPV of 0.90. The high predictive accuracy of machine learning using free text demonstrates that support of such analytics in future electronic health record systems can improve cohort identification.}

On the English Penn Treebank the model is on par with the existing state-of-the-art despite having 60\% fewer parameters. On languages with rich morphology (Arabic, Czech, French, German, Spanish, Russian), the model outperforms word-level/morpheme-level LSTM baselines, again with fewer parameters. The results suggest that on many languages, character inputs are sufficient for language modeling. Analysis of word representations obtained from the character composition part of the model reveals that the model is able to encode, from characters only, both semantic and orthographic information.}

Here we consider binary pairwise models and derive sufficient conditions for guaranteed tightness of (i) the standard LP relaxation on the local polytope LP+LOC, and (ii) the LP relaxation on the triplet-consistent polytope LP+TRI (the next level in the Sherali-Adams hierarchy). We provide simple new proofs of earlier results and derive significant novel results including that LP+TRI is tight for any model where each block is balanced or almost balanced, and a decomposition theorem that may be used to break apart complex models into smaller pieces. An almost balanced (sub-)model is one that contains no frustrated cycles except through one privileged variable.}

We propose a theoretical explanation to the striking observation that approximations based on linear programming (LP) relaxations are often tight on real-world instances.

The proposed grounding mechanism ensures a one-to-one identifiable and interpretable mapping between the latent factors and the target comorbidities. Qualitative assessment of the empirical results by clinical experts show that the proposed model learns clinically interpretable phenotypes which are also shown to have competitive performance on 30 day mortality prediction task. The proposed method can be readily adapted to any non-negative EHR data across various healthcare institutions.}

As medicine becomes increasingly precise, a patientâs electronic medical record phenotype will play an important role in triggering clinical decision support systems that can deliver personalized recommendations in real time. Learning with anchors presents a method of efficiently learning statistically driven phenotypes with minimal manual intervention. We developed a phenotype library that uses both structured and unstructured data from the EMR to represent patients for real-time clinical decision support. Eight of the phenotypes were evaluated using retrospective EMR data on emergency department patients using a set of prospectively gathered gold standard labels. We built the phenotype library with 42 publicly available phenotype definitions. Using information from triage time, the phenotype classifiers have an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of infection 0.89, cancer 0.88, immunosuppressed 0.85, septic shock 0.93, nursing home 0.87, anticoagulated 0.83, cardiac etiology 0.89, and pneumonia 0.90. Using information available at the time of disposition from the emergency department, the AUC values are infection 0.91, cancer 0.95, immunosuppressed 0.90, septic shock 0.97, nursing home 0.91, anticoagulated 0.94, cardiac etiology 0.92, and pneumonia 0.97. The resulting phenotypes are interpretable and fast to build, and perform comparably to statistically learned phenotypes developed with 5000 manually labeled patients. Learning with anchors is an attractive option for building a large public repository of phenotype definitions that can be used for a range of health IT applications, including real-time decision support.}

 abstract = {We present a new approach to population health, in which data-driven predictive models are learned for outcomes such as type 2 diabetes. Our approach enables risk assessment from readily available electronic claims data on large populations, without additional screening cost. Proposed model uncovers early and late-stage risk factors. Using administrative claims, pharmacy records, healthcare utilization, and laboratory results of 4.1 million individuals between 2005 and 2009, an initial set of 42,000 variables were derived that together describe the full health status and history of every individual. Machine learning was then used to methodically enhance predictive variable set and fit models predicting onset of type 2 diabetes in 2009-2011, 2010-2012, and 2011-2013. We compared the enhanced model with a parsimonious model consisting of known diabetes risk factors in a real-world environment, where missing values are common and prevalent. Furthermore, we analyzed novel and known risk factors emerging from the model at different age groups at different stages before the onset. Parsimonious model using 21 classic diabetes risk factors resulted in area under ROC curve (AUC) of 0.75 for diabetes prediction within a 2-year window following the baseline. The enhanced model increased the AUC to 0.80, with about 900 variables selected as predictive ( p &lt; 0.0001 for differences between AUCs). Similar improvements were observed for models predicting diabetes onset 1â3 years and 2â4 years after baseline. The enhanced model improved positive predictive value by at least 50\% and identified novel surrogate risk factors for type 2 diabetes, such as chronic liver disease (odds ratio [OR] 3.71), high alanine aminotransferase (OR 2.26), esophageal reflux (OR 1.85), and history of acute bronchitis (OR 1.45). Liver risk factors emerge later in the process of diabetes development compared with obesity-related factors such as hypertension and high hemoglobin A1c. In conclusion, population-level risk prediction for type 2 diabetes using readily available administrative data is feasible and has better prediction performance than classical diabetes risk prediction algorithms on very large populations with missing data. The new model enables intervention allocation at national scale quickly and accurately and recovers potentially novel risk factors at different stages before the disease onset.}

These embeddings are learned using a technique called neural language modeling from the natural language processing community. However, rather than learning the embeddings solely from text, we show how to learn the embeddings from claims data, which is widely available both to providers and to payers. We also show that with a simple algorithmic adjustment, it is possible to learn medical concept embeddings in a privacy preserving manner from co-occurrence counts derived from clinical narratives. Finally, we establish a methodological framework, arising from standard medical ontologies such as UMLS, NDF-RT, and CCS, to further investigate the embeddings and precisely characterize their quantitative properties.}

The algorithm is based on the conditional gradient method (Frank-Wolfe) and moves pseudomarginals within the marginal polytope through repeated maximum a posteriori (MAP) calls. This modular structure enables us to leverage black-box MAP solvers (both exact and approximate) for variational inference, and obtains more accurate results than tree-reweighted algorithms that optimize over the local consistency relaxation. Theoretically, we bound the sub-optimality for the proposed algorithm despite the TRW objective having unbounded gradients at the boundary of the marginal polytope. Empirically, we demonstrate the increased quality of results found by tightening the relaxation over the marginal polytope as well as the spanning tree polytope on synthetic and real-world instances.}

However, in practice the size of the vocabulary limits thedistributions applicable for this task: specifically, one has to either resort to local optimization methods, such as those used in neural language models, or work with heavily constrained distributions. In this work, we take a step towards overcoming these difficulties. We present a method for global-likelihood optimization of a Markov random field language model exploiting long-range contexts in time independent of the corpus size. We take a variational approach to optimizing the likelihood and exploit underlying symmetries to greatly simplify learning. We demonstrate the efficiency of this method both for language modelling and for part-of-speech tagging.}

This is often done by maximizing a score function on the space of labels, which decomposes as a sum of pairwise elements, each depending on two specific labels. The goal of this paper is to develop a theoretical explanation of the empirical effectiveness of heuristic inference algorithms for solving such structured prediction problems. We study the minimum-achievable expected Hamming error in such problems, highlighting the case of 2D grid graphs, which are common in machine vision applications. Our main theorems provide tight upper and lower bounds on this error, as well as a polynomialtime algorithm that achieves the bound.}

They admit an intuitive probabilistic interpretation, have a simple functional form, and enjoy widespread adoption in a variety of disciplines. Motivated by recent variational methods for learning deep generative models, we introduce a unified algorithm to efficiently learn a broad spectrum of Kalman filters. Of particular interest is the use of temporal generative models for counterfactual inference. We investigate the efficacy of such models for counterfactual inference, and to that end we introduce the "Healing MNIST" dataset where long-term structure, noise and actions are applied to sequences of digits. We show the efficacy of our method for modeling this dataset. We further show how our model can be used for counterfactual inference for patients, based on electronic health record data of 8,000 patients over 4.5 years.}

By specifying anchor variables, an expert encodes a certain amount of domain knowledge about the problem while the rest of learning proceeds in an unsupervised manner. The ability to build anchors upon standardized ontologies and the framework's ability to learn from unlabeled data promote generalizability across institutions. We additionally develop a user interface to enable experts to choose anchor variables in an informed manner. The framework is applied to electronic medical record-based phenotyping to enable real-time decision support in the emergency department. We validate the learned models using a prospectively gathered set of gold-standard responses from emergency physicians for nine clinically relevant variables.}

 abstract = {Chronic diseases, such as Alzheimer's Disease, Diabetes, and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease, usually progress slowly over a long period of time, causing increasing burden to the patients, their families, and the healthcare system. A better understanding of their progression is instrumental in early diagnosis and personalized care. Modeling disease progression based on real-world evidence is a very challenging task due to the incompleteness and irregularity of the observations, as well as the heterogeneity of the patient conditions. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic disease progression model that address these challenges. As compared to existing disease progression models, the advantage of our model is three-fold: 1) it learns a continuous-time progression model from discrete-time observations with non-equal intervals; 2) it learns the full progression trajectory from a set of incomplete records that only cover short segments of the progression; 3) it learns a compact set of medical concepts as the bridge between the hidden progression process and the observed medical evidence, which are usually extremely sparse and noisy. We demonstrate the capabilities of our model by applying it to a real-world COPD patient cohort and deriving some interesting clinical insights.}

Compared to earlier work on lifted belief propagation, our formulation leads to a convex optimization problem for lifted marginal inference and provides an upper bound on the partition function. We provide two approaches for improving the lifted TRW upper bound. The first is a method for efficiently computing maximum spanning trees in highly symmetric graphs, which can be used to optimize the TRW edge appearance probabilities. The second is a method for tightening the relaxation of the marginal polytope using lifted cycle inequalities and novel exchangeable cluster consistency constraints.}

Here we explore when and how the Bethe approximation can fail for binary pairwise models by examining each aspect of the approximation, deriving results both analytically and with new experimental methods.}

In contrast to traditional approaches to score-based structure learning, such as BDeu or MDL, the complexity penalty that we propose is data-dependent and is given by the probability that a conditional independence test correctly shows that an edge cannot exist. What really distinguishes this new scoring function from earlier work is that it has the property of becoming computationally easier to maximize as the amount of data increases. We prove a polynomial sample complexity result, showing that maximizing this score is guaranteed to correctly learn a structure with no false edges and a distribution close to the generating distribution, whenever there exists a Bayesian network which is a perfect map for the data generating distribution. Although the new score can be used with any search algorithm, we give empirical results showing that it is particularly effective when used together with a linear programming relaxation approach to Bayesian network structure learning.}

However, for many real-world inference problems, the typical decomposition has a large integrality gap, due to frustrated cycles. One way to tighten the relaxation is to introduce additional constraints that explicitly enforce cycle consistency. Earlier work showed that cluster-pursuit algorithms, which iteratively introduce cycle and other higher-order consistency constraints, allows one to exactly solve many hard inference problems. However, these algorithms explicitly enumerate a candidate set of clusters, limiting them to triplets or other short cycles. We solve the search problem for cycle constraints, giving a nearly linear time algorithm for finding the most frustrated cycle of arbitrary length. We show how to use this search algorithm together with the dual decomposition framework and cluster-pursuit. The new algorithm exactly solves MAP inference problems arising from relational classification and stereo vision.}

In this chapter, we introduce the general technique of dual decomposition through its application to the problem of finding the most likely (MAP) assignment in Markov random fields. We discuss both subgradient and block coordinate descent approaches to solving the dual problem. The resulting message-passing algorithms are similar to max-product, but can be shown to solve a linear programming relaxation of the MAP problem. We show how many of the MAP algorithms are related to each other, and also quantify when the MAP solution can and cannot be decoded directly from the dual solution.}

We propose a generative model of relevance which can be used to infer the relevance of a document to a specific user for a search query. The user-specific parameters of this generative model constitute a compact user profile. We show how to learn these profiles from a user's long-term search history. Our algorithm for computing the personalized ranking is simple and has little computational overhead. We evaluate our personalization approach using historical search data from thousands of users of a major Web search engine. Our findings demonstrate gains in retrieval performance for queries with high ambiguity, with particularly large improvements for acronym queries.}

This is one reason why Web search engines do a poor job of serving an important segment of the population: children. While there are many important problems in interface design, content filtering, and results presentation related to addressing children's search needs, perhaps the most fundamental challenge is simply that of providing relevant results at the right level of reading difficulty. At the opposite end of the proficiency spectrum, it may also be valuable for technical users to find more advanced material or to filter out material at lower levels of difficulty, such as tutorials and introductory texts. We show how reading level can provide a valuable new relevance signal for both general and personalized Web search. We describe models and algorithms to address the three key problems in improving relevance for search using reading difficulty: estimating user proficiency, estimating result difficulty, and re-ranking based on the difference between user and result reading level profiles. We evaluate our methods on a large volume of Web query traffic and provide a large-scale log analysis that highlights the importance of finding results at an appropriate reading level for the user.}

It leads to algorithms that are simple, in that they use existing decoding algorithms; efficient, in that they avoid exact algorithms for the full model; and often exact, in that empirically they often recover the correct solution in spite of using an LP relaxation. We give experimental results on two problems: 1) the combination of two lexicalized parsing models; and 2) the combination of a lexicalized parsing model and a trigram part-of-speech tagger.}

 abstract = {This paper introduces algorithms for non-projective parsing based on dual decomposition. We focus on parsing algorithms for non-projective head automata, a generalization of head-automata models to non-projective structures. The dual decomposition algorithms are simple and efficient, relying on standard dynamic programming and minimum spanning tree algorithms. They provably solve an LP relaxation of the non-projective parsing problem. Empirically the LP relaxation is very often tight: for many languages, exact solutions are achieved on over 98\% of test sentences. The accuracy of our models is higher than previous work on a broad range of datasets.}

 abstract = {Graphical models such as Markov random fields have been successfully applied to a wide variety of fields, from computer vision and natural language processing, to computational biology. Exact probabilistic inference is generally intractable in complex models having many dependencies between the variables. We present new approaches to approximate inference based on linear programming (LP) relaxations. Our algorithms optimize over the cycle relaxation of the marginal polytope, which we show to be closely related to the first lifting of the Sherali-Adams hierarchy, and is significantly tighter than the pairwise LP relaxation. We show how to efficiently optimize over the cycle relaxation using a cutting-plane algorithm that iteratively introduces constraints into the relaxation. We provide a criterion to determine which constraints would be most helpful in tightening the relaxation, and give efficient algorithms for solving the search problem of finding the best cycle constraint to add according to this criterion. By solving the LP relaxations in the dual, we obtain efficient message-passing algorithms that, when the relaxations are tight, can provably find the most likely (MAP) configuration. Our algorithms succeed at finding the MAP configuration in protein side-chain placement, protein design, and stereo vision problems.}

 abstract = {Many structured prediction tasks involve complex models where inference is computationally intractable, but where it can be well approximated using a linear programming relaxation. Previous approaches for learning for structured prediction (e.g., cutting-plane, subgradient methods, perceptron) repeatedly make predictions for some of the data points. These approaches are computationally demanding because each prediction involves solving a linear program to optimality. We present a scalable algorithm for learning for structured prediction. The main idea is to instead solve the dual of the structured prediction loss. We formulate the learning task as a convex minimization over both the weights and the dual variables corresponding to each data point. As a result, we can begin to optimize the weights even before completely solving any of the individual prediction problems. We show how the dual variables can be efficiently optimized using coordinate descent. Our algorithm is competitive with state-of-the-art methods such as stochastic subgradient and cutting-plane.}

This structure learning problem can be viewed as an inference problem where the variables specify the choice of parents for each node in the graph. The key combinatorial difficulty arises from the global constraint that the graph structure has to be acyclic. We cast the structure learning problem as a linear program over the polytope defined by valid acyclic structures. In relaxing this problem, we maintain an outer bound approximation to the polytope and iteratively tighten it by searching over a new class of valid constraints. If an integral solution is found, it is guaranteed to be the optimal Bayesian network. When the relaxation is not tight, the fast dual algorithms we develop remain useful in combination with a branch and bound method. Empirical results suggest that the method is competitive or faster than alternative exact methods based on dynamic programming.}

The relaxations are often succinctly expressed in the dual and reduce to different types of reparameterizations of the original model. The dual objectives are typically solved by performing local block coordinate descent steps. In this work, we show how to perform block coordinate descent on spanning trees of the graphical model. We also show how all of the earlier dual algorithms are related to each other, giving transformations from one type of reparameterization to another while maintaining monotonicity relative to a common objective function. Finally, we quantify when the MAP solution can and cannot be decoded directly from the dual LP relaxation.}

 abstract = {This paper presents and experimentally evaluates a new algorithm for efficient one-hop link-state routing in full-mesh networks. Prior techniques for this setting scale poorly, as each node incurs quadratic (n^2) communication overhead to broadcast its link state to all other nodes. In contrast, in our algorithm each node exchanges routing state with only a small subset of overlay nodes determined by using a quorum system. Using a two round protocol, each node can find an optimal one-hop path to any other node using only n^1.5 pernode communication. Our algorithm can also be used to find the optimal shortest path of arbitrary length using only n^1.5 log(n) per-node communication. The algorithm is designed to be resilient to both node and link failures. We apply this algorithm to a Resilient Overlay Network (RON) system, and evaluate the results using a large-scale, globally distributed set of Internet hosts. The reduced communication overhead from using our improved full-mesh algorithm allows the creation of all-pairs routing overlays that scale to hundreds of nodes, without reducing the systemâs ability to rapidly find optimal routes.}

Usual cluster-based LP relaxations enforce joint consistency on the beliefs of a cluster of variables, with computational cost increasing exponentially with the size of the clusters. By partitioning the state space of a cluster and enforcing consistency only across partitions, we obtain a class of constraints which, although less tight, are computationally feasible for large clusters. We show how to solve the cluster selection and partitioning problem monotonically in the dual LP, using the current beliefs to guide these choices. We obtain a dual message passing algorithm and apply it to protein design problems where the variables have large state spaces and the usual cluster-based relaxations are very costly. The resulting method solves many of these problems exactly, and significantly faster than a method that does not use partitioning.}

These relaxations can be solved efficiently using message-passing algorithms such as belief propagation and, when the relaxation is tight, provably find the MAP configuration. The standard LP relaxation is not tight enough in many real-world problems, however, and this has lead to the use of higher order cluster-based LP relaxations. The computational cost increases exponentially with the size of the clusters and limits the number and type of clusters we can use. We propose to solve the cluster selection problem monotonically in the dual LP, iteratively selecting clusters with guaranteed improvement, and quickly re-solving with the added clusters by reusing the existing solution. Our dual message-passing algorithm finds the MAP configuration in protein side-chain placement, protein design, and stereo problems, in cases where the standard LP relaxation fails.}

 abstract = {We describe a novel probabilistic approach to estimating errors in two-hybrid (2H) experiments. Such experiments are frequently used to elucidate protein-protein interaction networks in a high-throughput fashion; however, a significant challenge with these is their relatively high error rate, specifically, a high false-positive rate. We describe a comprehensive error model for 2H data, accounting for both random
and systematic errors. The latter arise from limitations of the 2H experimental protocol: in theory, the reporting mechanism of a 2H experiment should be activated if and only if the two proteins being tested truly interact; in practice, even in the absence of a true interaction, it may be activated by some proteins -- either by themselves or through promiscuous interaction with other proteins. We describe a probabilistic relational model that explicitly models the above phenomenon and use Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms to compute both the probability of an observed 2H interaction being true as well as the probability of individual proteins being self-activating/promiscuous. This is the first approach that explicitly models systematic errors in protein-protein interaction data; in contrast, previous work on this topic has modeled errors as being independent and random. By explicitly modeling the sources of noise in 2H systems, we find that we are better able to make use of the available experimental data. In comparison with Bader et al.âs method for estimating confidence in 2H predicted interactions, the proposed method performed 5-10\% better overall, and in particular regimes improved prediction accuracy by as much as 76\%.}
