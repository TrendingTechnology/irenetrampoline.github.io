<!-- ## About Me -->

<img class="profile-picture" src="irene.jpg">

I am a Ph.D. candidate at [MIT CSAIL](https://www.csail.mit.edu/), advised by Professor [David Sontag](http://people.csail.mit.edu/dsontag/) in the [Clinical Machine Learning](http://clinicalml.org/) group. My research focuses on machine learning and its applications to solving important real-world problems including *healthcare* and *fairness*.

Prior to MIT, I worked at [Dropbox](www.dropbox.com) as Data Scientist, Chief of Staff, and Machine Learning Engineer. I graduated from [Harvard](https://www.seas.harvard.edu/) with a joint AB/SM in Applied Math and Computational Engineering where I researched with [Michael Luca](http://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/profile.aspx?facId=602417) and [Ben Edelman](http://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/profile.aspx?facId=417579).

## News
 <!-- * I am organizing the NIPS 2018 Healthcare in Machine Learning workshop -->
 * May '18: Our paper [Why is My Classifier Discriminatory?](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.12002) is now available on arXiv.
 * May '18: I received the [Seth J. Teller Award for Excellence, Inclusion, and Diversity](http://www.eecs.mit.edu/news-events/announcements/eecs-celebrates-2018-recognizing-departments-outstanding-contributors).
 * Apr '18: I ran the [2018 Boston Marathon](https://twitter.com/irenetrampoline/status/986059482022273024) and raised over $10,000 for charity!
 * Jan '18: I was selected as a Finalist for the [Paul & Daisy Soros Fellowship](https://www.pdsoros.org/).

## Research
Current research projects include
1. **Congestive Heart Failure**: How can we combine electronic health records with mechanistic information to better treat heart failure? What signal do echocardiograms contain? In collaboration with [Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center](http://www.bidmc.org/).
2. **Health Knowledge Graph**: How can we build a structure to capture causal information on symptoms and diseases? Can we capture and quantify error in the model?
3. **Fairness in machine learning**: How can we make models that represent people of all genders and races? In a world of limited resources, how can we create more inclusive models?

## Papers

1. **Why Is My Classifier Discriminatory?** Irene Chen, Fredrik D. Johansson, David Sontag. *Preprint.* [[arXiv]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.12002)
2. **Sources of Unfairness in Intensive Care Unit Mortality Scores.** Irene Chen, Fredrik D. Johansson, David Sontag. *Women in Machine Learning Workshop at NIPS 2017.*

## Teaching

At Harvard, I was awarded the [Derek Bok Center Certificate of Distinction in Teaching](https://bokcenter.harvard.edu/awards) for outstanding teaching evaluations.

I have served on the teaching staff for the following Harvard classes.
 * Linear Algebra and Real Analysis I, Paul Bamberg
 * Microeconomic Theory, Ed Glaeser
 * Linear Algebra and Real Analysis II, Paul Bamberg
 * Multivariable Calculus, Evelyn Hu and Avi Shapiro
